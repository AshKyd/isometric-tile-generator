# Isometric tile generator

Scratching an itch. I wanted a tool to help me generate isometric tiles for a game I'm working on. Spent more time making the tool than the game thus far.

Wishlist:

- Rotate images
- Load/save shadow amount on edges
- Pick primary interface colour from images
- some kind of load/save + preview multiple tiles together
